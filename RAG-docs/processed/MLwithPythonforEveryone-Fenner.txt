1. Let’s Discuss Learning

1.1 Welcome
From time to time, people trot out a tired claim that computers can “only do what they are told to do.” The claim is taken to mean that computers can only do what their programmers know how to do and can explain to the computer. This claim is false. Computers can perform tasks that their programmers cannot explain to them. Computers can solve tasks that their programmers do not understand. We will break down this paradox with an example of a computer program that learns.
I’ll start by discussing one of the oldest—if not the oldest known—examples of a programmed machine-learning system. I’ve turned this into a story, but it is rooted in historical facts. Arthur Samuel was working for IBM in the 1950s and ...

2. Some Technical Background

2.1 About Our Setup
We’re about to get down—funk style—with some coding. The chapters in this book started life as Jupyter notebooks. If you’re unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, they are a very cool environment for working with Python code, text, and graphics in one browser tab. Many Python-related blogs are built with Jupyter notebooks. At the beginning of each chapter, I’ll execute some lines of code to set up the coding environment.
The content of mlwpy.py is shown in Appendix A. While from module import * is generally not recommended, in this case I’m using it specifically to get all of the definitions in mlwpy.py included in our notebook environment without taking up forty lines of code. Since scikit-learn ...

3.1 Classification Tasks
Now that we’ve laid a bit of groundwork, let’s turn our attention to the main attraction: building and evaluating learning systems. We’ll start with classification and we need some data to play with. If that weren’t enough, we need to establish some evaluation criteria for success. All of these are just ahead.
Let me squeeze in a few quick notes on terminology. If there are only two target classes for output, we can call a learning task binary classification. You can think about {Yes, No}, {Red, Black}, or {True, False} targets. Very often, binary problems are described mathematically using {-1, +1} or ...

4.1 A Simple Regression Dataset
Regression is the process of predicting a finely graded numerical value from inputs. To illustrate, we need a simple dataset that has numerical results. sklearn comes with the diabetes dataset that will serve us nicely. The dataset consists of several biometric and demographic measurements. The version included with sklearn has been modified from raw numerical features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each column. That process is called standardizing or z-scoring the features. We’ll return to the standard deviation later; briefly, it is a measure of how spread ...

5.1 Evaluation and Why Less Is More
Lao Tzu: Those that know others are wise. Those that know themselves are Enlightened.
The biggest risk in developing a learning system is overestimating how well it will do when we use it. I touched on this risk in our first look at classification. Those of us that have studied for a test and thought we had a good mastery of the material, and then bombed the test, will be intimately familiar with this risk. It is very, very easy to (1) think we know a lot and will do well on an exam and (2) not do very well on the exam. On a test, we may discover we ...

In the previous chapter, we discussed evaluation issues that pertain to both classifiers and regressors. Now, I’m going to turn our attention to evaluation techniques that are appropriate for classifiers. We’ll start by examining baseline models as a standard of comparison. We will then progress to different metrics that help identify different types of mistakes that classifiers make. We’ll also look at some graphical methods for evaluating and comparing ...

We’ve discussed evaluation of learning systems and evaluation techniques specific to classifiers. Now, it is time to turn our focus to evaluating regressors. There are fewer ad-hoc techniques in evaluating regressors than in classifiers. For example, we don’t have confusion matrices and ROC curves, but we’ll see an interesting alternative in residual plots. Since we have some extra mental and physical space, we’ll spend a ...

We are going to dive into a few additional techniques for regression. All of these are variations on techniques we’ve seen before. Two are direct variations on linear regression, one splices a support vector classifier with linear regression to create a Support Vector Regressor, and one uses decision trees for regression instead of classification. As such, much of what we’ll talk about will be somewhat familiar. We’ll ...

We’ve already introduced models, parameters, and hyperparameters in Section 5.2.2.4. I’m about to bring them up again for two reasons. First, I want you to see a concrete analogy between (1) how we write simple Python functions in different ways by varying their code and arguments and (2) how learning models use parameters and hyperparameters. Second, we’ll turn our attention towards choosing good hyperparameters. When we fit a model, we are choosing good parameters. We need some sort of well-defined process to choose good ...

In a perfect world, our standard classification algorithms would be provided with data that is relevant, plentiful, tabular (formatted in a table), and naturally discriminitive when we look at it as points in space.
In reality, we may be stuck with data that is

Only an approximation of our target task
Limited in quantity or covers only some of many possibilities
Misaligned with the prediction method(s) we are trying to apply to it
Written as text or images which are decidedly not in an example-feature table

15.1 Optimization
When we try to find a best line, curve, or tree to match our data—which is our main goal in training—we want to have an automated method do the work for us. We’re not asking the hot dog vendor for a quick stock tip: we need an algorithm. One of the principal—principled—ways to do this is by assessing our cost and looking for ways to lower that cost. Remember, the cost is a combination of the loss—how well our model’s predictions match the training data—and the complexity of the model. When we minimize cost, we try to achieve a small loss while keeping a low complexity. We can’t always get to that ideal, but that’s our goal.
