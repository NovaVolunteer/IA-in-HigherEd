Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data


In my opinion, machine learning, the application and science of algorithms that make sense of data, is the most exciting field of all the computer sciences! We are living in an age where data comes in abundance; using self-learning algorithms from the field of machine learning, we can turn this data into knowledge. Thanks to the many powerful open source libraries that have been developed in recent years, there has probably never been a better time to break into the machine learning field and learn how to utilize powerful algorithms to spot patterns in data and make predictions about future events.
In this chapter, you will learn about the main concepts and different types of machine learning. ...

Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification


In this chapter, we will make use of two of the first algorithmically described machine learning algorithms for classification: the perceptron and adaptive linear neurons. We will start by implementing a perceptron step by step in Python and training it to classify different flower species in the Iris dataset. This will help us to understand the concept of machine learning algorithms for classification and how they can be efficiently implemented in Python.
Discussing the basics of optimization using adaptive linear neurons will then lay the groundwork for using more sophisticated classifiers via the scikit-learn machine learning library in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning ...

Working with Unlabeled Data – Clustering Analysis


In the previous chapters, we used supervised learning techniques to build machine learning models, using data where the answer was already known—the class labels were already available in our training data. In this chapter, we will switch gears and explore cluster analysis, a category of unsupervised learning techniques that allows us to discover hidden structures in data where we do not know the right answer upfront. The goal of clustering is to find a natural grouping in data so that items in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those from different clusters.
Given its exploratory nature, clustering is an exciting topic, and in this chapter, you will learn about the ...

Parallelizing Neural Network Training with TensorFlow


In this chapter, we will move on from the mathematical foundations of machine learning and deep learning to focus on TensorFlow. TensorFlow is one of the most popular deep learning libraries currently available, and it lets us implement neural networks (NNs) much more efficiently than any of our previous NumPy implementations. In this chapter, we will start using TensorFlow and see how it brings significant benefits to training performance.
This chapter will begin the next stage of our journey into machine learning and deep learning, and we will explore the following topics:

How TensorFlow improves training performance
Working with TensorFlow's Dataset API (tf.data) to build input pipelines ...

Going Deeper – The Mechanics of TensorFlow


In Chapter 13, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with TensorFlow, we covered how to define and manipulate tensors and worked with the tf.data API to build input pipelines. We further built and trained a multilayer perceptron to classify the Iris dataset using the TensorFlow Keras API (tf.keras).
Now that we have some hands-on experience with TensorFlow neural network (NN) training and machine learning, it's time to take a deeper dive into the TensorFlow library and explore its rich set of features, which will allow us to implement more advanced deep learning models in upcoming chapters.
In this chapter, we will use different aspects of TensorFlow's API to implement NNs. In particular, we will ...

Reinforcement Learning for Decision Making in Complex Environments


In the previous chapters, we focused on supervised and unsupervised machine learning. We also learned how to leverage artificial neural networks and deep learning to tackle problems encountered with these types of machine learning. As you'll recall, supervised learning focuses on predicting a category label or continuous value from a given input feature vector. Unsupervised learning focuses on extracting patterns from data, making it useful for data compression (Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction), clustering (Chapter 11, Working with Unlabeled Data – Clustering Analysis), or approximating the training set distribution for generating new data (Chapter ...
